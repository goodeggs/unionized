# Unionized tech talk outline

- Unionized isn't a new library
  - Good Eggs has been using it for a long time (~1.5 years!)
  - this talk might contain stuff that isn't new for some of you
  - feel free to toss rotten tomatoes
  - but to keep you paying attention, there is actually a bunch of new stuff too

- What is unionized for?
  - Building up objects for tests
  - Example of life without unionized
    - bare test w/ complex object
    - test w/ fixture
    - test w/ generator function
    - test w/ garbanzo Factory
  - Missing feature: Modularity
      - Consistent interface
      - Configurability
      - Code reuse
      - Composition

- So how does it work? (Example: Stripe API)
  - Extremely basic factories
  - Factory parameters as functions
  - Entire factories as functions
  - Overriding factory parameters
  - Objects with dot notation
  - Arrays

  - Composition (factories made of factories)
  - Inheritance (child factories)

  - Logic (factories can read overrides)
  - Asynchronous factories
  - Asynchronous factories with promises

  - Hooks

  - Autogenerated factories from Mongoose
  - Eventually: autogenerated factories from a json-schema

- Credits
  - Alex Gorbatchev built the library that unionized was forked from
  - Contributions from Sherman, Ben & Danny
